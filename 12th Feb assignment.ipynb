    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. When an exceptional event occurs, the program's execution is interrupted, and the program execution is transferred to the nearest appropriate exception handler. Exceptions can occur for a variety of reasons, such as incorrect user input, out-of-memory errors, network failures, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a syntax error is a type of error that occurs when the Python interpreter encounters an error in the syntax of the program. Syntax errors occur when the program code is not written according to the correct Python syntax rules. Common examples of syntax errors include incorrect indentation, missing parentheses, missing commas, and invalid variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter when the program is being compiled, while exceptions are detected at runtime when the program is being executed. When a syntax error is encountered, the Python interpreter stops execution and displays an error message describing the problem. In contrast, when an exception is raised during program execution, the Python interpreter looks for the nearest appropriate exception handler and executes it."
